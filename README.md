# C++ Function Template Demonstration
demonstating function templates in C++

The end goal of this program is to demonstrate an appropriate use for function templates. I (the programmer) have been provided with a text file containing
both integer and string values. This program will read from that input file and store the integer values in an integer vector and the string values into
a string vector. Using function templates that will work with multiple data types, this program will output the minimum and maximum values stored in both
the integer and string vectors. One function template will return the minimum value for both of the vectors while a second function template will return the
maximum value for both of the vectors.
